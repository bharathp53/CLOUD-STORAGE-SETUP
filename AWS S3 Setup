To set up cloud storage on AWS, follow the steps below.
This guide will walk you through creating a bucket, uploading example files, and configuring access permissions.


Step 1: Create an S3 Bucket
    1. Log in to the AWS Management Console.

    2. Navigate to S3 under the Storage section.

    3. Click Create bucket.

    4. Enter a unique Bucket name (e.g., bharathp5).

    5. Select the Region where you want the bucket to reside.

    6. Configure additional settings (e.g., versioning, logging) if needed.

    7. Click Create bucket.

Step 2: Upload Example Files
    1. Open the newly created bucket.

    2. Click Upload and select files from your local machine (e.g., CLOUD COMPUTING.pdf).

    3. Click Upload to complete the process.

Step 3: Configure Access Permissions
    1. Go to the Permissions tab of your bucket.

    2. Under Block public access, uncheck the options if you want to make the bucket publicly accessible (use with caution).

    3. Under Bucket Policy, add a policy to grant access. For example:

    json
    {
      "Version": "2012-10-17",
      "Statement": [
        {
          "Effect": "Allow",
          "Principal": "*",
          "Action": "s3:GetObject",
          "Resource": "arn:aws:s3:::bharathp5/*"
        }
      ]
    }
    This policy allows public read access to all objects in the bucket.

    4. Save the changes.

Step 4: Verify Access
    1. Open the uploaded file's URL (e.g., https://bharathp5.s3.eu-north-1.amazonaws.com/CLOUD+COMPUTING.pdf).

    2. Ensure the file is accessible based on the permissions configured.
